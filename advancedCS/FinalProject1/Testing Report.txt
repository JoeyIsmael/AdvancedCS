Nice job so far. The graphics are pretty neat and your game is easy to understand and fun to play! Things to work on: add sound and complete a challenge. In addition, I would recommend that you prevent users from moving after the game has been completed in order to avoid confusion for the users. Good luck and have fun!

Thank you so much for the feedback, I am glad you enjoyed that draft of the game. I worked on some of the areas you recommended that I implemented in the game. For example, I added sound for when the player grabs a gem and a different sound for when the user touches fire. In addition, I completed the challenge were the grid also scatters 6 obstacles around the grid that do not harm the player. Finally, I also included a boolean that is set to false once the game is complete to prevent the users from moving after the game is over. 

For your project, you should increase the grid size because there is a small chance that a gem spawns surrendered by fire. Increasing the grid would minimize that chance. I like how you can play the game across different machines. A suggestion to improve the game is to add obstacles that do not make the player lose a health (i.e rivers and rocks).

Thank you for taking the time to play my game and give feedback. I took your suggestions into account by increasing the size of the grid such that the error you encountered is minimized and I also added obstacles that do not harm the player such as rivers, rocks, and trees.
